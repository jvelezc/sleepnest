Dark Mode Baby Care App: A Material Design Approach for Sleep Insights

We’re building a dark mode app designed with Material Design guidelines, prioritizing human-centered design principles in both language and aesthetics. The app will serve as a comprehensive tool for parents and caregivers to log and evaluate their baby’s feeding and sleep patterns, focusing on usability and clarity.

Feature 1: Feeding Log
To help track feeding habits, the app will capture:

Date and Time: When the feeding session occurred.
Feeding Method:
Breastfeeding: Log the duration (in minutes).
Bottle Feeding: Log both the duration and the amount consumed (in ounces).
Solids: Log the duration.
Session Details: Provide flexibility for caregivers to record any observations during feeding, such as baby’s mood or interruptions.
Feature 2: Sleep Tracking
Since sleep data is critical for evaluating patterns and improvements, the app will allow users to log:

Sleep Start Time: When the baby fell asleep.
Wake-Up Time: When the baby woke up.
Sleep Quality Notes: Optional space for caregivers to note observations such as frequent waking, fussiness, or external factors (e.g., environment or illness).
Design and User Experience Considerations
Dark Mode:
Reduce eye strain during nighttime logging.
Follow Material Design's Dark Theme guidelines for contrast and readability.
Human-Centered Language:
Use intuitive, non-technical prompts (e.g., “When did your baby fall asleep?”).
Avoid jargon to keep the app approachable for all caregivers.
Aesthetic Design:
Soft tones and rounded elements for a comforting interface.
High-contrast text and buttons to ensure readability even in low light.
Goal for Sleep Experts
The logged feeding and sleep data will provide a structured and detailed record for sleep experts to evaluate:

Feeding habits and their impact on sleep patterns.
Consistencies or irregularities in sleeping and waking times.
Correlations between feeding types (e.g., breast vs. bottle) and sleep quality.
